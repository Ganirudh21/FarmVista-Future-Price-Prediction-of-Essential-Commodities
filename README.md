# FarmVista-Future-Price-Prediction-of-Essential-Commodities
FarmVista is an AI-ML solution that predicts future prices of key agricultural commodities like rice, pulses, onions, and potatoes. It helps farmers and consumers tackle price fluctuations caused by changing supply, demand, climate, and economic factors.
By building a machine learning model trained on a rich dataset containing historical prices, production levels, consumption rates, climate data, inflation, and global price indices, this system enables farmers, policymakers, and supply chain stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding cultivation, storage, and sales strategies.

Key Objectives:
1)Predict the future market prices of essential agri-horticultural commodities with high accuracy.

2)Enable farmers to plan cropping and storage based on market trends and expected profitability.

3)Support government and supply chain entities in creating more resilient and responsive policies to manage food inflation and shortages.

4)Reduce economic risk and uncertainty for those dependent on agriculture.

Features:
üî¢ Multi-parameter Input Model
Incorporates a wide range of real-world factors such as:

#Historical Price Trends

#Climate & Monsoon Rainfall

#Inflation Rate, Interest Rate

#Production & Consumption Levels

#Cost of Inputs (fertilizer, fuel)

#Export/Import Prices

#CPI & WPI Indices

üìä ML-Based Forecasting
Uses advanced models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and LSTM to deliver short-term and long-term price predictions, trained on cleaned and normalized historical datasets.
